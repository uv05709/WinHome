I built WinHome to create a **lightweight, dependency-free configuration tool** that runs **natively on Windows** as a **single-file EXE** — no Python, Ruby, or agent installations required. This project was heavily inspired by NixOS's `home-manager` but tailored specifically for the Windows ecosystem.

WinHome focuses on the real needs of **Windows developers**, including:

- First-class **Winget** support  
- Deep **WSL** provisioning  
- Native **Registry tweaks** and system settings  

The goal is to make Windows environment automation as simple, fast, and reliable as possible.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before using WinHome, ensure your environment meets the following requirements:

*   **Operating System:** Windows 10 (Version 1809 or higher) or Windows 11.
*   **Privileges:** Must be executed with **Administrator** privileges to modify system settings and install packages.
*   **Internet Connection:** Required for downloading packages and updates.

---

## 🚀 Installation

WinHome ships as a **self-contained single EXE** (no .NET runtime needed), compatible with all Windows x64 systems.

1. Visit the **Releases Page**
2. Download **WinHome.exe**
3. Run it from PowerShell or CMD

### Quick Install (PowerShell)

```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/DotDev262/WinHome/releases/latest/download/WinHome.exe" -OutFile "WinHome.exe"
```

> **Post-Install Note:** For easier global access, we recommend moving `WinHome.exe` to a folder included in your system's `PATH` environment variable (e.g., `C:\Users\<User>\bin`).

---

## 🔧 How It Works & Configuration Wiki

WinHome reads a declarative `config.yaml` that defines your desired system state.
A built-in **Reconciliation Engine** compares it to the live system and ensures everything matches.

* Tracks system state in `winhome.state.json`
* Detects and corrects configuration drift
* Fully idempotent — run it once or 100 times: *the result is identical*

For a detailed breakdown of all configuration options, refer to the [Configuration Wiki](./docs/config.md).

For complete, real-world setup examples (Developer, Minimalist, Gamer), see the [Configuration Cookbook](./docs/cookbook.md).

### ⚠️ Secrets & Security Warning

**Do not commit `config.yaml` to public repositories** if it contains sensitive information such as API tokens, passwords, or private environment variables. We recommend using a private repository or `.gitignore` for configurations containing secrets.

---

## ✨ Features

### 📦 Universal Package Management

* Winget (with auto-install support)
* Scoop
* Chocolatey

### 🐧 WSL Management

* Auto-install and configure distros
* Run post-provision scripts
* Kernel settings and version management

### 🔗 Dotfiles Sync

### ⚙️ System Configuration

### 🛡️ Safe Dry-Run Mode

### 🔄 Deterministic Idempotency

---

## 🛡️ Security & Reliability

WinHome implements enterprise-grade security controls to prevent common infrastructure automation pitfalls.

### 🔒 Context Awareness (RegistryGuard)
WinHome actively detects if it is running as `SYSTEM` (common in CI/CD or Scheduled Tasks) and **blocks attempts to modify `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`**. This prevents the "Admin Context Trap" where settings are accidentally applied to the LocalSystem profile instead of the logged-in user.

### 💾 Crash Resilience (Write-Through State)
The state engine uses a **Write-Through** pattern. Every successful action (e.g., installing an app, applying a registry key) is immediately flushed to disk (`winhome.state.json`). If the process crashes or is terminated (Ctrl+C), your progress is saved, and the next run will resume correctly without "zombie" state issues.

### 📦 Plugin Sandboxing
External plugins (Bun, Uv) run in a sandboxed process with strict limits:
*   **Memory Limit:** 10MB max output buffer to prevent OOM attacks.
*   **Time Limit:** 30-second execution timeout to prevent hangs.
*   **Isolation:** Plugins communicate strictly via JSON over Stdin/Stdout.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

Built with modern .NET engineering patterns:

* **Dependency Injection** (`Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting`)
* **Strategy Pattern** across package managers
* **Testable Core** via abstractions (Registry, FS, Processes)
* **Cross-Platform Dev**: Can be developed/unit-tested on Linux & macOS.
* **CI/CD** via GitHub Actions (SingleFile & Native builds)

---

## 📘 Usage

```
.\WinHome.exe [options]
```

### Options

* `--config <path>`
* `--dry-run`, `-d`
* `--profile <name>`
* `--debug`
* `--diff`

---

## 🧩 Configuration Example (`config.yaml`)

```yaml
version: "1.0"

apps:
  - id: "Microsoft.PowerToys"
    manager: "winget"
  - id: "neovim"
    manager: "scoop"

dotfiles:
  - src: "./files/.gitconfig"
    target: "~/.gitconfig"

envVars:
  - variable: "EDITOR"
    value: "nvim"
    action: "set"
  - variable: "Path"
    value: "%USERPROFILE%\bin"
    action: "append"

registryTweaks:
  - path: "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced"

git:
  userName: "John Doe"
  userEmail: "john.doe@example.com"
  settings:
    "core.editor": "code --wait"
    "init.defaultBranch": "main"

wsl:
  update: true
  defaultDistro: "Debian"
  defaultVersion: 2
  distros:
    - name: "Ubuntu-20.04"
    - name: "Debian"

profiles:
  work:
    git:
      userName: "John Doe (Work)"
      userEmail: "john.doe@work.com"
```

---

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

WinHome is fully portable. To uninstall it:

1.  Delete the `WinHome.exe` file.
2.  Delete the state file `winhome.state.json` (located in the same directory).

No registry keys or hidden folders are left behind by the tool itself.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

**"Winget not recognized"**
> Ensure the **App Installer** is updated from the Microsoft Store. WinHome attempts to use the system-level Winget.

**PowerShell Script Errors**
> If you encounter execution policy errors, try running `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser` in an administrative PowerShell window.
